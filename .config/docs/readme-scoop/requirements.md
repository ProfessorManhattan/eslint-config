## Requirements

In order to leverage the software that this Scoop bucket provides, you first need to [install Scoop on your system](https://github.com/ScoopInstaller/Scoop/wiki/Quick-Start). Scoop is used to install software on Windows. If you are looking for a Linux or macOS installer, then this repository is not for you. After you have Scoop installed, you must then add our Scoop bucket to install the scoops that are housed in this repository / bucket. You can install the Scoop bucket by running:

```shell
scoop bucket add org {{repository.github}}.git
```

## Example Install

After the Scoop bucket is added, you can install software. For example, if you want to install [Bodega](https://github.com/megabyte-labs/Bodega) then you would run:

```shell
scoop install installdoc/bodega
```
