## Requirements

In order to leverage the software that this Homebrew tap provides, you first need to [install Homebrew on your system](https://brew.sh/). It is available on macOS, Linux, and you can install it on Windows with WSL. After you have Homebrew installed, you must then add our tap to install the software that is housed in this repository. You can install the tap by running:

```shell
brew tap installdoc/tap
```

## Example Install

After the tap is installed, you can install software by specifying its short name. For instance, if you wanted to install [Bodega](https://github.com/megabyte-labs/Bodega) then you would run:

```shell
brew install bodega
```
