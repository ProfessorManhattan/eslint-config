## Requirements

To run this project, all you need is [Python 3](https://www.python.org/) and [pip3](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/). See the [Installation section](#installation) for instructions that include alternate installation methods that do not require Python to be installed.

If you are interested in contributing or would like to make some modifications, please see the [CONTRIBUTING](/docs/CONTRIBUTING.md) guide. There are a handful of build tools we incorporate into the development process. All of them are installed automatically via our Taskfile system. You can get started customizing this project by running:

```shell
bash .config/scripts/start.sh
task start
task --list
```
